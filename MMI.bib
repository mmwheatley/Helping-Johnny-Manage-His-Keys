abstract = {As evidenced by the proliferation of phishing attacks and keystroke loggers, we know that human beings are not well-equipped to make trust decisions about when to use their passwords or other personal credentials. Public key cryptography can reduce this risk of attack, because authentication using PKI is designed to not give away sensitive data. However, using private keys on standard platforms exposes the user to "keyjacking"; mobile users wishing to use keypairs on an unfamiliar and potentially untrusted workstation face even more obstacles. In this paper we present the design and prototype of PorKI, a software application for mobile devices that offers an alternative solution to the portable key problem. Through the use of temporary keypairs, proxy certificates, and wireless protocols, PorKI enables a user to employ her PKI credentials on any Bluetooth-enabled workstation, including those not part of her organization's network, and even those that might be malicious. Moreover, by crafting XACML policy statements that limit the key usage to the workstation's trustworthiness level, and inserting these statements into extensions of the proxy certificates, PorKI provides the user or the relying party with the ability to limit the amount of trust that can be put in the temporary keypair used on that workstation, and thus the scope of a potential compromise},

@article{Lyle2013,
abstract = {As people use an increasing number of smart devices for their everyday computing, it is surprising that these powerful, internet-enabled devices are rarely connected together to create personal networks. The webinos project is an attempt to make this possible so that resources can easily be shared between devices, regardless of the operating system or network they are using. However, increased connectivity raises a number of security and privacy issues, and in this paper we introduce a public key infrastructure designed to be suitable for personal computing across multiple devices. We recognize the need for our PKI to work on both mobile and home networks, use existing online user identities and take into consideration the different interaction styles found on smart devices in different form factors. We propose a set of principles for personal key infrastructures, describe our implementation and outline how it mitigates common threats and issues.},

@article{Stajano2011,
abstract = {From a usability viewpoint, passwords and PINs have reached the end of their useful life. Even though they are convenient for imple- menters, for users they are increasingly unmanageable. The demands placed on users (passwords that are unguessable, all different and never written down) are no longer reasonable now that each person has to manage dozens of passwords. Yet we cant abandon them until we come up with an alternative method of user authentication that is both usable and secure. We present an alternative design based on a hardware token called Pico that relieves the user from having to remember passwords and PINs.We discuss how Pico would work, not merely in the relatively straightforward case of remote login to a web site but also in all the other contexts in which users must at present remember passwords and PINs. After discussing an ideal clean-slate design we consider possible variations that might trade off some security in exchange for backwards compatibility, convenience and better prospects for widespread adoption.},
